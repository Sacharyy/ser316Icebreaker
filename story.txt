For lunch I was thinking about going to a Biergarten. 
I had a craving for Bratwurst.
So I got in my Porsche and went on my way to lunch.
While driving to lunch, I waved to Mehlhase driving a Audi
I finally arrived in Munich, ready to eat,
but all i could find was a brot.
As I began to eat, a hund grabbed my brot and started to run away!
I nabbed the hund, took my brot, and stoled Gausses' BMW.
I fled down Hauptstrasses whith the klimaanlage blowing through my hair!
Then the hund and I drove to the flughafen listening to musik.
The hund then jumped out of the BMW because smelled the baeckerei nearby.
